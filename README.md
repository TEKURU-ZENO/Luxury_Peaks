# Luxury_Peaks
This is my first project on GitHub titled "Luxury Peaks" which is basically an online luxury hotel services.
# Aim in ths project
So basically this project simulates a go-cart type of online hotel services where there many in house services inside a luxury hotel . All the purchases can be done via a admin mode and it only has a admin mode for editing and well as inserting data . Only the home page can be accessed by non admin users.
# Future works
This project will be included in another project titled "EVERYTHING" which is basically the amalgamation of all the services available online and offline so basically everything in a touch or rather a program in this case.
